PLEAT SAW COMMISSIONING DIAGNOSTICS - 2025-10-23
===============================================================================

SUMMARY:
--------
✓ Software: Installed and running
✓ Web Dashboard: http://192.168.68.109:5000
✗ RS-485 Modbus: NO DEVICES RESPONDING
✗ Nextion HMI: Port /dev/ttyAMA0 missing

SERIAL PORTS:
-------------
Available: /dev/ttyS0 (mini UART)
Missing: /dev/ttyAMA0 (used by Bluetooth)
Current Modbus port: /dev/ttyS0

MODBUS SCAN RESULTS:
--------------------
All slaves (1-10): NO RESPONSE
Error: "No response received, expected at least 4 bytes"

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
--------------------
Modbus devices are not responding because:
  1. Devices not powered, OR
  2. RS-485 wiring not connected (A+, B-), OR
  3. Wrong baud rate on slave devices, OR
  4. RS-485 converter not working

REQUIRED HARDWARE CHECKS:
--------------------------
1. What RS-485 HAT/converter are you using?
2. Are device power LEDs ON? (N4D3E16, ESP32-A, ESP32-B)
3. Is RS-485 wiring correct? (A+ and B- connected)
4. Are slave IDs set correctly? (1, 2, 3)
5. Are slave baud rates set to 9600?

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
Please verify the hardware connections and power, then we can continue troubleshooting.
